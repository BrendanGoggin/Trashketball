Objective:
You have 3 attempts to get the highest total score: Bouncing off the walls, your head, and kicking all increment points.
Once the ball hits the ground, you lose an attempt and your total score increments. If you end an attempt by landing
the ball in the bin instead, you get an extra bonus.

Controls:
WASD or Arrows to Move. Y to run. J to kick. K to head.
